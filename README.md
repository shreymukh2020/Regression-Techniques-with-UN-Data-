# Regression-Techniques-with-UN-Data

How do various factors related to socioeconomic and health conditions impact countries' life expectancy and consequently determine the countries that are in most need of funding by the UN?

Our goal is to develop a Regression model that can predict the Life expectancy of a country based on several Physical, Social and Economical features that will be instrumental towards the decision regarding the amount of Financial Aid to be allocated for that country.
